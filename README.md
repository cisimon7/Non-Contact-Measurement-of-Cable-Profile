# Non-Contact-Measurement-of-Cable-Profile
Computer Vision Semester Project

This project is still in progress and is not yet completed

Progress so far:
<ol>
<li>Definition for the Simulation of the project</li>
<li>Model of the Catenary Equation representing the profile of the cable and is used to find the sagging of the cable</li>
<li>Detection of the Aruco markers in the video</li>
<li>Drawing of the axis representing the orientation of the AruCo markers</li>
</ol>

Work Left undone
Detection of the cables in the images
Get points on the cable in the picture and transform into the 3D scene and get real representation of the cable 
Model the real points of the cable
Measure Sagging of the cable
